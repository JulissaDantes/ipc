## :warning: Disclaimer

The project is still work in progress.

IPC Contracts have been audited up to [this commit](https://github.com/consensus-shipyard/ipc/commits/d5c7462880399b1d62755e4b93a27b2466e22c8a).

Other parts of the stack ([Fendermint client](./fendermint), [IPC CLI](./ipc/cli) etc) **have not been audited**.

Moreover, **the system is missing critical recovery functionality in case of crashes**. There are multiple ways in which you may lose funds moved into an IPC subnet, and we strongly advise against deploying IPC on mainnet and/or using it with tokens with real value.

## What is IPC?

IPC is framework for scaling blockchains. Users of IPC can dynamically spawn new blockchain subsystems (subnets) as children of any existing network. IPC is based on the design principles of on-demand horizontal scaling. Child subnets leverage the security of their parent subnets by periodically checkpointing their state in the parentâ€™s state. IPC provides native communication across subnets within the IPC framework.
See [IPC Whitepaper](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/consensus-shipyard/IPC-design-reference-spec/main/main.pdf).

Current implementation of IPC consists of:
- Fendermint client built on top of [CosmosSDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/) which also exposes Ethereum RPC API
- A set of [Solidity smart contracts](./contracts)
- [CLI](./ipc/cli) for interacting with IPC

It's worth noting that Fendermint leverages [Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM)](https://github.com/filecoin-project/ref-fvm/) as its execution environment. 
FVM is a runtime for WASM-based actors (think of "actor" as "smart contract") which can be deployed on subnets if high-performance is key.      
What's more, Fendermint uses FVM extension called FEVM which brings EVM-compatibility. Therefore, the Fendermint-based subnets are able run solidity smart contracts as well. 

## Goals of IPC

The goal of IPC is to enable decentralized apps to reach planetary-scale through recursively scalable subnets, sub-second transactions, robust compute workloads, and highly adaptable WebAssembly runtimes tailored to dev requirements. It aims to enable the creation of flexible, living networks of customizable sidechains or "subnets", which can achieve massive scaling by running parallel chains that interoperate with one another.

Here are some practical examples of how IPC use cases:
- Distributed Computation: Spawn ephemeral subnets to run distributed computation jobs.
- Coordination: Assemble into smaller subnets for decentralized orchestration with high throughput and low fees.
- Localization: Leverage proximity to improve performance and operate with very low latency in geographically constrained settings.
- Partition tolerance: Deploy blockchain substrates in mobile settings or other environments with limited connectivity.

## For Developers

### Prerequisites

On Linux (links and instructions for Ubuntu):

- Install system packages: `sudo apt install build-essential clang cmake pkg-config libssl-dev protobuf-compiler git curl`.
- Install Rust. See [instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- Install cargo-make: `cargo install --force cargo-make`.
- Install Docker. See [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).
- Install Foundry. See [instructions](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

On MacOS:

- Install Xcode from App Store or terminal: xcode-select --install
- Install Homebrew: https://brew.sh/
- Install dependencies: brew install jq
- Install Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install (if you have homebrew installed rust, you may need to uninstall that if you get errors in the build)
- Install Cargo make: cargo install --force cargo-make
- Install docker: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/
- Install foundry: https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation

### Building

```
# make sure that rust has the wasm32 target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# add your user to the docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker

# clone this repo and build
git clone https://github.com/consensus-shipyard/ipc.git
cd ipc
make

# building will generate the following binaries
./target/release/ipc-cli --version
./target/release/fendermint --version
```

### Run tests

```
make test
```

### Code organization

- `ipc/cli`: A Rust binary crate for our client `ipc-cli` application that provides a simple and easy-to-use interface to interact with IPC as a user and run all the processes required for the operation of a subnet.
- `ipc/provider` A Rust crate that implements the `IpcProvider` library. This provider can be used to interact with IPC from Rust applications (and is what the `ipc-cli` uses under the hood).
- `ipc/api`: IPC common types and utils.
- `ipc/wallet`: IPC key management and identity.
- `fendermint`: Peer implementation to run subnets based on Tendermint Core.
- `contracts`: A reference implementation of all the actors (i.e. smart contracts) responsible for the operation of the IPC (Inter-Planetary Consensus) protocol.
- `ipld`: IPLD specific types and libraries

### Documentation and Guides

**We've prepared a [quick start guide](https://docs.ipc.space/quickstarts/deploy-a-subnet) that will have you running and validating on your own subnet quickly, at the cost of detailed explanations.**

For further documentation, see:

- [docs/contracts.md](./docs/ipc/contracts.md) for instructions on how to deploy FEVM actors on subnets.
- [docs/usage.md](./docs/ipc/usage.md) for instructions on how to use the `ipc-cli` to interact with subnets (from managing your identities, to sending funds to a subnet).
- [docs/deploying-hierarchy.md](./docs/ipc/deploying-hierarchy.md) for instructions on how to deploy your own instance of IPC on a network.

If you are a developer, see:

- [docs/developers.md](./docs/ipc/developers.md) for useful tips and guides targeted for IPC developers.
- [specs](./specs) for in-depth description of all concepts

### Connecting to a rootnet

You can deploy an IPC hierarchy from any compatible rootnet. The recommended option is to use Filecoin Calibration, but you can also deploy your own.

### Running a subnet in Calibration

Calibration is the primary testnet for Filecoin. It already hosts the IPC actors and can be used as a rootnet on which to deploy new subnets.

In order to use the `ipc-cli` with Calibration we need to have access to a full node syncing with the network. The easiest way to achieve this is to use a [public RPC](https://docs.filecoin.io/networks/calibration/rpcs/). You also need the addresses of the deployed contracts.

If it is the first time that you use your `ipc-cli`, to initialize cli configuration you can run `ipc-cli config init`. This will populate a new default config file in `~/.ipc/config.toml`.

The suggested configuration for the `ipc-cli` is:

```
keystore_path = "~/.ipc"

# Filecoin Calibration
[[subnets]]
id = "/r314159"

[subnets.config]
network_type = "fevm"
provider_http = "https://api.calibration.node.glif.io/rpc/v1"
gateway_addr = "0x1AEe8A878a22280fc2753b3C63571C8F895D2FE3"
registry_addr = "0x0b4e239FF21b40120cDa817fba77bD1B366c1bcD"
```

To be able to interact with Calibration and run new subnets, some FIL should be provided to, at least, the wallet that will be used by the `ipc-cli` to interact with IPC. You can request some tFIL for your address through the [Calibration Faucet](https://faucet.calibration.fildev.network/funds.html).
