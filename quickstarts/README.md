# Quickstarts

This section covers quickstarts to get started on core functionalities of IPC. We will cover:

1. [How to deploy a subnet](deploy-a-subnet.md). This is for developers who want to operate their own private subnet.&#x20;
2. [How to deploy smart contracts to a subnet](deploy-smart-contract-to-mycelium-testnet.md). This is for developers who want to build dApps on top of an existing subnet.&#x20;
